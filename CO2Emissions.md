# Analysis for CO2 Emissions Globally

## Introduction

This analysis explores the global production of CO2 and contributing
factors over the last 50 years spanning from 2000 to 2023. The focus of
this analysis is to Identify top contributors and regional activity,
show trends over time, tie emissions production to other possible
contributing factors, and identify emissions trends. This analsysis aims
to identify and assess top factors of CO2 emissions and climate change
to provide a comprehensive picture on what the causes are, who the main
producers are, and where we all go from here in terms of CO2 production
and climate change.

## Key Findings and Answers

The final analysis step was key in answering the questions put forward
at the beginning of this analysis. We now have dignificant findings to
report and answers to the following questions:

-   **Who are the main contributors?**
    -   The United States, China, and India.
-   **Does GDP and GDP growth directly tie to CO2 production?**
    -   Although there is a logical assumption that higher production
        would increase CO2 production, the data does not show this.
        There is no strong connection between GDP growth and CO2
        production.
-   **Are there any other ties to CO2 production?**
    -   The strongest ties to CO2 production are the countries that are
        contributors. Time and time again, they appear to be the same
        culprits overtaking all other countries by a large margin. There
        are also implications we can make about the origin of these
        emissions. There seems to indicate industrial use that is much
        greater than individual use in the top CO2 emitting countries.
        This seems to correspond to the low per capita rates in these
        large, high CO2 producing countries while their overall rates of
        emission tower among the rest of the nations we have data for.
-   **What are the CO2 production trends globally?**
    -   Globally, the top contributors mentioned earlier are the lead
        culprits in the output of CO2 emissions. The trend overall seems
        to be increasing CO2 production, not decreasing. Although the
        United States seems to be turning around, the gains are modest
        compared to the steady or even steep rise in CO2 emissions from
        the other top contributors.
-   **How do we address these trends?**
    -   We challenge the top contributors to adopt green energy
        strategies and primarily replace coal, with gas and oil not far
        behind. It is important for society to keep these operations
        running optimally, but it should not come at the cost of CO2
        emissions if we can help it. There is very little the individual
        can do to address these trends on their own as it seems that
        industry is the main cause of CO2 emissions.
-   **What are the leading causes of CO2 production?**
    -   Primarily coal, oil, and natural gas - in that order.
-   **How do we mitigate CO2 production knowing this cause?**
    -   We elect for green energy solutions instead of using coal, oil,
        or natural gas where possible. Although this can be done on the
        level of the individual, the real bulk of the impact seems to be
        from industry. Limiting industry use of these sources and
        providing green energy alternatives would be the best way to
        mitigate CO2 production overall.

## Conclusion

CO2 levels are rising. Climate Change is happening. These are facts and
the disaster on the horizon is fast approaching. We owe it to ourselves
to look at our production of greenhouse gasses and harmful energy habits
and question what we can do better. Between the years of 2000-2023
alone, we see a rapid and concerning increase in CO2 levels globally. We
identified the top contributors and all but ruled out several factors of
this increase in production that would otherwise seem intuitive.

For example, we tend to put a lot of weight on individual production
with sentiments such as “I can reduce my carbon footprint by getting a
more fuel-efficient vehicle” or “I can plant a tree to mitigate the
carbon emissions I contribute to.” Although these sentiments are not
wrong to express, we have to recognize that the data paints a different
picture. The data tells us that, more than likely, the bulk of the
emissions are produced by industry and spread across large populations
in a metric of “per capita” emissions. This seems to say that the higher
the population, the more emissions there are to go around, so higher
emission rates are allowed for big companies, corporations, and
industries as long as the individual impact across the population is
relatively low. This is not an indictment on industry or capital, but
the data seems to indicate that individual consumption is not as large
of an impact as we may think it is when we look at the per capita values
for countries around the world. Instead, it seems that, in most places,
industry outputs more emmissions than the population can, making smaller
countries with smaller populations show up in our analysis of per capita
emissions.

We also took a look at overall emissions, which led us to identify the
top contributors and use this data to make visualizations and analyze
the data on a smaller sample size instead of taking a broad, global view
of the data. Having done this, we identified the United States, China,
and India to be the top contributors. China and India have very large
populations, so this would make sense that their per capita influence is
so low, but their overall contributions are so high. However, the United
States data tells an interesting story through all of this analysis.
Although it is a top contributor, it seems that carbon production is
decreasing or at least leveling out over the time range of 2000-2023.
This is inconsistent with the larger population countries, but possibly
indicates a shift to green energy sources.

Finally, we analyzed energy usage and CO2 sources. These findings were
striking. We identified that coal was the main source of CO2 emissions
in recent years and usage is, in fact, increasing in both China and
India. Maybe just as surprising, we see coal usage declining slightly in
the United States. Coal is widely used as an energy source for heat by
individuals, but mostly, it is used for coal-fired electric plants to
generate electricity according to the International Energy Agency
<https://www.iea.org/energy-system/fossil-fuels/coal>, making this an
industrial CO2 cost, providing power to the facilities that need it in
high amounts. This implication indicates that the responsibility for
these emissions mainly rests on the shoulders of industry instead of the
individual.

Although the value of coal usage is declining, the United States still
has a significant responsibility regarding the CO2 emission rate, which
is mostly a result of coal usage. However, our three largest
contributors seem to overall be increasing coal usage over time. This
seems to be a major factor in the rising CO2 levels around the world.
Obviously, this is in conjunction with regular usage of gas, oil, and
other sources, but this main source of coal usage seems to be the
driving force of CO2 production, and by correlation, Climate Change.

## Visual Analysis Insights

### 

#### CO2 Emissions Per Capita

-   Per capita calculations may be useful, but many main contributors do
    not appear.

#### Total CO2 Emissions

-   This visual contains the main contributors, but indicates regional
    usage instead of individual average usage.

#### Population and Total Production Comparison

-   The first visual gives insight into population and production per
    capita.

-   The second visual is ordered in rank of highest contributors with
    the per capita values adjacent to the population.

-   These numbers indicate a disparity between per capita values and
    populations.

-   This disparity may be linked to industrial produciton of CO2 instead
    of personal as the massive CO2 production is offset and spread out
    amongst larger populations.

#### Top 15 Countries by GDP analysis

-   CO2 production by countries with the highest GDP to compare across
    contributing countries.

-   Slices were taken exluding the top producers and at the bottom 12,
    then 9 of the top 15 GDP countries, we see that there is a
    uniformity, making the United States, China, and India clear top
    contributors to CO2 production.

#### Top 3 Countries by Emissions - GDP Analysis

-   Top Emitting countries had GDP growth and emissions over time
    measured against eachother.

-   The United states seems to have a plateau or a slight decline in CO2
    emissions whil still increasing GDP.

-   Both China and India are increasing emissions, but at a much lower
    rate than they are increasing GDP over time.

-   We can conclude that these trends are unique to the regions and GDP
    does not have a direct link to emissions in this case.

#### Top 3 Countries by Emssions - Source Analysis

-   Emission sources were compared for each of the top 3 CO2 producing
    countries.

-   Coal was a clear outlier with oil and natural gas trailing
    significantly far behind.

-   The United States exhibited a decrease in coal usage, but a steady
    use of oil and natural gas.

-   This may indicate an adoption of green energy alternatives in place
    of coal.

-   This may also indicate high industrial usage of coal in both India
    and China.

#### Top 3 Countries by Emissions - Coal Usage Analysis

-   Coal usage is down in the United states, but it is rising
    significantly in China and India

-   Higher industry demand for coal usage in these countries is the
    highest contributing factor to CO2 production and Climate change of
    all the sources we have provided data on.

## Gathering Data

All data for this project was collected and produced by the “Our World
in Data” organization. The CSV used in this analysis can be found in
this repository: <https://github.com/owid/co2-data?tab=readme-ov-file>.
The data collected spans hundreds of years, but the data used in this
analysis will only span from 1973 onward. This data was imported to
Rstudio to refine and clean the data for the purpose of this anlaysis.

## Cleaning and Organizing the Data

The first step in cleaning the data is to gather the data from all
countries by the date range we are looking for (1973-2023). This reduced
the number of lines of data to 50191.

    CO2_50Year <- CO2_AllData[CO2_AllData$year >= 1973, ]
    view(CO2_50Year)

Next, I had to create tables for each planned visualization category.
These categories being top CO2 producers per capita, top CO2 producers
generally, GDP factor considered in CO2 production, CO2 source (gas,
coal, oil, cement, flaring), and CO2 production per unit energy.

CO2 producers per capita - organize data into a table containing only
countries, population, and CO2 measurements. Also include the
differentiation of source per capita for a more comprehensive analysis.

    # Remove all NA or null values for population or CO2 for calculation of CO2 per capita
    CO2_PerCapita <- CO2_50Year%>%
      filter(country !="" & population != "" & co2 != "")%>%
      select(country, year, population, co2, co2_per_capita, coal_co2_per_capita, gas_co2_per_capita, oil_co2_per_capita, cement_co2_per_capita, flaring_co2_per_capita)
      view(CO2_PerCapita)

CO2 producers generally - organize data into a table containing only
countries and CO2 measurements. Include the CO2 measurement and country
name for a more broad use in analysis.

    # Remove all NA or null values for CO2 for calculation of total CO2 per country
    CO2_General <- CO2_50Year%>%
      filter(co2 != "")%>%
      select(country, population, year, co2)
      view(CO2_General)

GDP factor of CO2 production - organize data into a table containing
countries, gdp, and CO2 measurements. Include the gdp measurement,
country and CO2 measurements.

    # Remove all NA or null values for gdp and co2 for calculation of CO2 production compared to gdp
    CO2_GDP <- CO2_50Year%>%
      filter(co2 != "" & gdp != "")%>%
      select(country, year, co2, gdp, co2_per_gdp)
      view(CO2_GDP)

CO2 source - organize data into a table containing countries and each
source total CO2 contribution. Include the country, CO2 measurements,
and source of CO2 variables.

    # Remove all NA or null values for any source variable and co2 variable
    CO2_Source <- CO2_50Year%>%
      filter(co2 != "" & coal_co2 != "" & gas_co2 != "" & cement_co2 != "" & oil_co2 != "" & flaring_co2 != "")%>%
      select(country, co2, coal_co2, gas_co2, cement_co2, oil_co2, flaring_co2, year)
      view(CO2_Source)

Co2 production per unit energy - organize data into a table containing
countries, co2 measurements, and energy usage calculations. Include the
country, CO2 measurements, energy per capita and gdp, and CO2 per unit
energy calculation.

    # Remove all NA or null values for CO2 and CO2 per unit energy calculation
    CO2_Energy <- CO2_50Year%>%
      filter(co2 != "" & energy_per_capita != "" & energy_per_gdp != "" & primary_energy_consumption != "")%>%
      select(country, year, co2, energy_per_capita, energy_per_gdp, primary_energy_consumption)
      view(CO2_Energy)

## Analysis

The main objective of this analysis is to find direct ties to CO2
emissions, potential causes, leading producers, and regional production
trends. The patterns and differences between countries will be analysed
using the data provided to identify connections to regional behaviors
and practices, gdp and industrial production, population and industrial
growth, and innovation in green energy production. These insights aim to
positively affect and inform both researchers and the general population
of the production of CO2 across the globe and how that affects us all.

### CO2 Emissions Per Capita

First, our objective is to identify and rank the top CO2 producers per
capita. This provides us information about the regions with the highest
output per person to grant insight into individual contribution and will
be very useful when comparing to total CO2 output. All of the following
values are based off of 2023 data.

    # Organize data into table with filtered results for the top 15 countries
    Top_15 <- CO2_PerCapita%>%
      filter(year == 2023)%>%
      mutate(calc_per_capita = round(digits = 2, (co2/population)*1000000))%>%
      arrange(desc(calc_per_capita))%>%
      slice_head(n = 15)
      
      

    ggplot(Top_15, aes(x = fct_reorder(country, calc_per_capita, .desc = TRUE), y = calc_per_capita))+
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 0.7), width = .9, fill = "steelblue") +
      geom_text(aes(label = round(calc_per_capita, 1)),
          vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +  
      labs(
        title = "Top 15 Countries by CO2 per Capita",
        x = "Country",
        y = "CO2 emmissions per capita (tonnes)"
      ) +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)))+
      theme(
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)
      )

![](CO2Emissions_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

    rm(Top_15)

As we can see in the graph above, some of the commonly known
contributors are on the list, but much lower than maybe expected, while
the highest per capita contributor is Qatar by a long shot. This does
not tell the whole story, however.

### Total CO2 Emissions

Second, we want to frame the per capita emissions in context with the
total emissions per country. This will be done in two steps. First, we
will find the highest producers overall and present their output.All of
the following values are based off of 2023 data.

    # Organize data into table with filtered results for the top 15 countries
    Top_15 <- CO2_General%>%
      filter(year == 2023)%>%
      filter(!grepl("GCP|Asia|World|countries|Europe|America|shipping|aviation|Africa|Oceania", country))%>% 
    # This table includes several values for very specific types of output and regions that are not classified as countries. 
    # This eliminates all that fall into the top 15.
      arrange(desc(co2))%>%
      slice_head(n = 15)

      

    ggplot(Top_15, aes(x = fct_reorder(country, co2, .desc = TRUE), y = co2))+
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 0.7), width = .9, fill = "steelblue") +
      geom_text(aes(label = round(co2, 1)),
          vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +  
      labs(
        title = "Top 15 Countries by CO2 Production",
        x = "Country",
        y = "CO2 emmissions (Million Tonnes)"
      ) +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)))+
      theme(
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)
      )

![](CO2Emissions_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

    rm(Top_15)

This graph may look more familiar and expected. However, this only gives
us the total emisions per region, not a good look at how much each
individual person is contributing to the total of CO2 emissions.

### Population and Total Production Comparison

Next, we have to compare these values across the top countries. A side
by side of total output and population should paint a better picture
about which nations really are the highest contributors to CO2
production globally. All of the following values are based off of 2023
data.

    Top_15 <- CO2_PerCapita%>%
      mutate(calc_per_capita = round(digits = 1, (co2/population)*10000000))%>%
      mutate(calc_population = population/1000000) %>%
      filter(year == 2023)%>%
      arrange(desc(calc_per_capita))%>%
      pivot_longer(
        cols = c(calc_per_capita, calc_population),
        names_to = "Type",
        values_to = "Value"
      ) %>%
      mutate(Type = recode(Type,
                           calc_per_capita = "CO2 per person (Kg)",
                           calc_population = "Population (Million)"))%>%
      mutate(calc_per_capita = round(digits = 2, (co2/population)*1000000))%>%
      slice_head(n = 30)
     


    ggplot(Top_15, aes(
            x = fct_reorder(country, calc_per_capita, .desc = TRUE),
            y = Value,
            fill = Type
          )) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), width = 0.8) +
      geom_text(aes(label = round(Value, 0)), 
                position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
      labs(
        title = "Top 15 Countries by CO2 Emissions Per Capita",
        x = "Country",
        y = "CO2 Emissions",
        fill = "Type"
      ) +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +
      scale_fill_manual(values = c("CO2 per person (Kg)" = "steelblue", "Population (Million)" = "darkorange")) +
      theme(
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)
      )

![](CO2Emissions_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

    rm(Top_15)

And we also compare these values according to total CO2 emissions. This
will pick out any outliers that are present between the two metrics.

    Top_15 <- CO2_General%>%
      mutate(calc_per_capita = round(digits = 1, (co2/population)*10000000))%>%
      mutate(calc_population = population/1000000) %>%
      filter(!grepl("GCP|Asia|World|countries|Europe|America|shipping|aviation|Africa|Oceania", country))%>%
      filter(year == 2023)%>%
      arrange(desc(co2))%>%
      pivot_longer(
        cols = c(calc_per_capita, calc_population),
        names_to = "Type",
        values_to = "Value"
      ) %>%
      mutate(Type = recode(Type,
                           calc_per_capita = "CO2 per person (Kg)",
                           calc_population = "Population (Million)"))%>%
      mutate(calc_per_capita = round(digits = 2, (co2/population)*1000000))%>%
      slice_head(n = 30)
     


    ggplot(Top_15, aes(
            x = fct_reorder(country, co2, .desc = TRUE),
            y = Value,
            fill = Type
          )) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), width = 0.8) +
      geom_text(aes(label = round(Value, 0)), 
                position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
      labs(
        title = "Top 15 Countries by CO2 Emissions",
        x = "Country",
        y = "CO2 Emissions Per capita/Population",
        fill = "Type"
      ) +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +
      scale_fill_manual(values = c("CO2 per person (Kg)" = "steelblue", "Population (Million)" = "darkorange")) +
      theme(
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)
      )

![](CO2Emissions_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

    rm(Top_15)

This graph finally gives us some combined data that we can use to
analyze the per capita production of CO2 and maybe shed some light on
how individual contributions are affecting the overall issue of
emissions. As we can see in the visual above, the higher the population,
typically, the lower the CO2 production per person. This may indicate
that individual production of CO2 by the average Joe isn’t the primary
contributing factor to rising levels. These numbers indicate that the
highest producers being China, India, and the United States have
relatively low individual human impact, but still produce the highest
amounts of CO2 overall. This may indicate that industry such as
production and manufacturing may be increasing the production of CO2 gas
more than individual contributions

How do I come to this conclusion? Well, with higher populations, the
output of major contributors such as coal plants, factories, and product
transportation, for example, would be spread across a larger population,
making the number *seem* smaller in comparison, but, in fact, represents
a much higher contribution.I believe we can conclude that, instead of
lower population regions simply being more frivolous about their
individual contributions of CO2 emissions, the *large* producers in the
form of industry contribute more across the board, showing the higher
populations with a relatively lower contribution per person and the
lower populations consistently showing a relatively higher contribution
per person. The actual massive output of CO2 by industry is simply
spread out across the entire population in these numbers, skewing the
actual results to indicate a lower individual output in certain
countries, when, in fact, the higher contributions to CO2 emissions stem
from something bigger than individual contributions.

## CO2 Emissions by GDP

Next in our investigation, we identify trends based on a key national
production factor such as GDP (Gross Domestic Product). This will
identify trends in industry and provide data relating industrial growth
to CO2 production. For this analysis, the top 15 countries based on GDP
will be analyzed based on data ranging from 2000 to 2023. There will be
a broader comparison between higher production nations and the output of
CO2 emissions. There will also be a narrower investigation into outlier
producers and their GDP and CO2 emission contributions.

### Top 15 Countries by GDP analysis

In this first visualization, we see the top 15 countries by GDP and
analyze the CO2 production over time since 2000. We also select a
narrower slice of the top 15, but excluding the three primary outliers -
The United States, China and India.

Now we take an even narrower slice to identify more general trends.
These remove the outliers of The United States, China, India, Russia,
Japan, and Germany. This plot looks quite messy, but the information we
can gather from a closer look is what trends, up or down, that the
majority of top producers are experiencing.

After inspecting this data, it is clear that some countries have
increased or decreased CO2 production over the years to various degrees,
but their impact is relatively stable. There are 5 countries that report
an increase in CO2 production since 2000 and 4 countries that report a
decrease. It also seems like the next big outlier in projection would be
Indonesia - a nation that was nearly the lowest producer in this slice
in 2000, but has reached the highest producing nation of these 9 in
2023.

### Top 3 Countries by Emissions - GDP Analysis

Now, we seek to answer the question “what does GDP have to do with CO2
production? How is it affecting or affected by CO2 produciton?”. Here,
we compare the GDP and CO2 emissions across the top three producers of
CO2 who happen to also be the top 3 countries in terms of GDP - The
United States, China, and India. This fact alone implies a correlation
between the two metrics, but how much direct impact does that have on
the actual CO2 production values over time?

the CO2 production has been slowly decreasing over the years.

While China’s graph seems early on what we would want to expect from a
GDP and CO2 production correlation, it quickly takes a turn around 2010
and the CO2 production begins to stabilize and plateau.

India seems to have a more correlative graph showing CO2 production
rising pretty steadily as the GDP also increases. This is of course far
from evidence of causation, but the CO2 production seems to also be
increasing with the GDP at a variable and decreasing rate relative to
the GDP increase.

What we can conclude from this cursory study into the closeness of the
correlation between CO2 production and GDP is that there may not be as
strong or as close a correlation to GDP growth and CO2 production as
once thought or observed. The numbers seem to consistently point to a
relatively lower CO2 production year over year as compared to the GDP
growth. Some countries may experience a correlative increase in CO2
production, but it is not one to one and the CO2 production is being
handily outpaced by GDP growth in the data for the top 3 contributors in
the world. In fact, with the data given, it seems that CO2 production is
only very slightly higher year over year, while the GDP increases remain
steady and strong.

I believe the insights here point to one of two causes; Either the GDP
has nothing to do with CO2 production, which is counter intuitive since
production and industry are the main drivers of GDP and also most
impactful in terms of CO2 production *or* GDP growth is being achieved
via alternativel methods of energy production such as green energy
solutions like solar, wind, and hydroelectric. This green energy impact
hypothesis is supported by the fact that the US and China both rely more
heavily on green energy sources than they have in the past. This would
also explain the sudden change in CO2 production by China around 2010,
the steady increase in CO2 emissions in India even still as they are not
as well-known for the use of green energy, and the slight but surprising
recent downward trend of CO2 emissions seen in the US data.

In conclusion, GDP does not seem to have the impact it once did or one
would imagine it would on the CO2 production overall. It may have a
slight impact in that countries with less access to green energy sources
are more likely to produce more CO2 as the GDP grows, but more research
would be necessary to come to any such conclusions. Insofar as it
pertains to our slice of the three top contributors in the world, we do
not see this trend, but instead a divergent trend in which the GDP
increases much faster than CO2 production, leading us to believe that
there is no strong correlation to GDP growth and CO2 production.

## CO2 Emissions by Source

If there is little correlation between individual usage or GDP growth
and CO2 production increases, it is possible that CO2 production is
driven by a particular source. What method of energy production is the
main cause of the increase and overall output of CO2 emissions in recent
history? In this analysis, we will take each source and compare it to
other sources of CO2 emissions. In this analysis, we will only be using
the top three contributing countries (The United States, China, and
India) as these are the highest producers of CO2 and should give us the
most accurate sample to determine what sources are producing the most
CO2.

### Top 3 Countries by Emssions - Source Analysis

First, we will break down each individual country and separate out all
of the values for the sources between the years 2000 and 2023. This will
allow us to compare source usage between country and compare source
usage between other sources listed within a given country.

The United States’ data indicates that coal as an energy source is on a
steep decline, while gas and oil mostly remain stady or are steadily and
slowly increasing. This indicates a decline in the use of coal, which
may be contributing to the steady overall decline of CO2 emissions in
the United States since 2000. This would corroborate the findings that
lead us to beleive more green energy alternatives are being used and are
effective as the gas and oil rates remain relatively stagnant and most
likely have a lot of individual use, whereas coal is not used by
individuals nearly as often.

India exhibits a considerable rise in coal usage over the years, much
like China. Oil is also increasing, but at a much more modest rate.

### Top 3 Countries by Emissions - Coal Usage Analysis

From these graphs, we can conclude that coal is, by far, the leading
cause of CO2 emissions worldwide. At the very least, it is the main
contributor source used by the main contributing countries for CO2
emission. If lesser contributors follow this trend in the future or show
anything other than a steep decline in coal usage, it would be
reasonable to conclude that coal is the main source of CO2 emissions.

This data shows the top 3 contributors side-by-side to give a
perspective of how the coal contributions look on a scale compared
between these three large producers.
